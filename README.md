# Restaurant Reservation App

This is a simple Flask web application for managing restaurant reservations. It supports user registration, login, posting restaurants and creating reservations.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

The app uses an SQLite database (`data.db`) created automatically on first run.
